Cardano SL Report Server
========================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/input-output-hk/cardano-report-server.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/input-output-hk/cardano-report-server)

Server for collecting CSL and related logs.

```
Usage: cardano-report-server [-p|--port INTEGER] [--logsdir FILEPATH]
                             [--size-limit BYTES] [--store-custom]
                             [--zd-send-logs] [--zd-email STRING]
                             [--zd-token STRING] [--zd-account NAME] [--version]
  CardanoSL reporting server daemon

Available options:
  -p,--port INTEGER        Port server is running on
  --logsdir FILEPATH       Directory server will be saving logs in
  --size-limit BYTES       Maximum body size allowed (will send 413 responses if
                           bigger)
  --store-custom           Store custom reports
  --zd-send-logs           Send logs from custom reports to Zendesk
  --zd-email STRING        Email to access zendesk
  --zd-token STRING        Zendesk api token
  --zd-account NAME        Zendesk account name (first part of account URL)
  -h,--help                Show this help text
  --version                Show version
```

Zendesk Custom Reports
----------------------

These are bug reports sent by users directly through the Daedalus
wallet frontend. This feature can be enabled using the `--zd-`
options:

 * `--zd-account` -- The first part of `https://ACCOUNT.zendesk.com`.
 * `--zd-email` -- E-mail of a user registered in the Zendesk
   account. This user must have role "Agent" or higher.
 * `--zd-token` -- API access token which can be obtained at
   `https://ACCOUNT.zendesk.com/agent/admin/api/settings`.
 * `--zd-send-logs` -- Optional switch which enables uploading of logs
   from Daedalus.

To register a user for this purpose, the [Zendesk API][1] can be used:

```
curl https://ACCOUNT.zendesk.com/api/v2/users/create_or_update.json \
  -d '{"user": {"name": "Report Server Agent", "email": "report-server@iohk.io", "role": "agent" }}' \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST \
  -v -u 'EMAIL/token:BASE64_TOKEN'
```
How it works 
------------
After startup Cardano-Report-Server inititalizes the Log holder directory
with given options, additionaly creates the directory if not present. Then
it makes a Zendesk-Agent which contains all the necessary details about the
zendesk account and then the agent authenticates with zendesk. After that it
creates a `serverContext` which contains the information about the server:
```
data ServerContext = ServerContext
    { scZendeskParams      :: !(Maybe ZendeskParams) -- ^ If Nothing, zd is turned off
    , scStoreCustomReports :: !Bool -- ^ If we store logs on custom
                                   -- report. This will only be used
                                   -- if zendesk integration is on,
                                   -- because we store response too.
    , scLogsHolder         :: !LogsHolder
    }
```
Then it launches the server application which sends Log data to zendesk or
stores locally if required. Cardano-Report-Server logs the following report:
```
-- | Type of report.
data ReportType
    = RCrash Int
    -- ^ This type is used only to report crash of application.
    | RError Text
    -- ^ The type of report used when a local error (most likely
    -- assertion violation or anything else that indicates a bug)
    -- happens. «Local» means that error most likely affects only one
    -- node for which this error happened.
    | RMisbehavior { rmIsCritical  :: Bool
                   -- ^ Whether misbehavior can break the system and
                   -- must be addressed ASAP.  Example of critical
                   -- misbehavior: chain quality is closed to
                   -- 50%. Example of non-critical misbehavior: fork
                   -- happened in bootstrap era. The latter should be
                   -- investigated, but doesn't mean that the system's
                   -- operability is threatened.
                   , rmDescription :: Text
                   -- ^ What exactly is suspicious\/wrong.
                    }
    -- ^ This type of report indicates global problems which most
    -- likely affect all nodes.
    | RInfo Text
    -- ^ The type of report used to send statistical or any other
    -- useful information and doesn't indicate anything
    -- bad\/strange\/suspicious.
    | RCustomReport { crEmail :: Text
                      -- ^ The user's email address
                    , crSubject :: Text
                      -- ^ The title of the report
                    , crProblem :: Text
                      -- ^ Description of the issue(s)
                    }
    -- ^ This is a custom user report coming directly from Daedalus.
```
Additionally Cardano-Report-Server sends this metadata along with the report:
```
-- | Metadata sent with report.
data ReportInfo = ReportInfo
    { rApplication :: Text
      -- ^ Application name, e.g. "cardano-explorer" or "deadalus".
    , rVersion     :: Version
      -- ^ Application version.
    , rBuild       :: Text
      -- ^ Build information.
    , rOS          :: Text
      -- ^ OS information.
    , rDate        :: UTCTime
      -- ^ Date report was created on.
    , rMagic       :: Int32
      -- ^ Cluster magic.
    , rReportType  :: ReportType
      -- ^ Type of report.
    }
```
